Explanation:

express, path, body-parser, and mongoose modules are imported.
The Express application instance is created and stored in the app variable.
The MongoDB connection is established using mongoose.connect(). We provide the connection URL (mongodb://localhost:27017/dummy_data) and specify options ({ useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }).
A schema for the user data is defined using mongoose.Schema. It defines the structure of the user document.
A model for the user schema is created using mongoose.model(). This model represents a collection in the MongoDB database and provides an interface for interacting with it.
Static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, images) are served from the 'public' directory using express.static() middleware.
Middleware functions from body-parser are used to parse URL-encoded and JSON request bodies.
A route handler (GET /) is defined to serve the login form (index.html).
Another route handler (POST /login) is defined to handle the submission of the login form. It extracts the email and password from the request body, creates a new user document using the User model, and attempts to save it to the MongoDB database. If the save operation is successful, it sends a 'Login successful!' response. If an error occurs during the save operation, it sends a 500 status code with an error message.
The server listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 3000 (app.listen(PORT)).
This code sets up a basic Express server with MongoDB integration to handle user login submissions and save user data to the database.
